# Hi there, I'm [Ashwin](https://ashwinhariharan.com/about) üòÑ üëã

üéØ *Full-stack dev | Storyteller through code & blog | Bridging product and engineering*

I'm a full-stack developer building scalable applications with a strong focus on usability and maintainability. I also love making technical jargon understandable for both technical and non-technical audiences on my [tech blog](https://booleanhunter.com/blog).

## My software engineering principles

- Programs should be written for humans to read, and not just for computers to run
- Favor simple code that relies mostly on cross-language paradigms, as opposed to framework-specific abstractions
- Don‚Äôt just blindly assume past tool choices are sacred
- Prefer legibility over succinctness while writing code

## Technologies

While I'm trying to think of one specialization to deep dive in, I've used the following technologies at some point and have thoroughly enjoyed creating with them:

### Languages

![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/javascript-%23323330.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=%23F7DF1E)
![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/typescript-%23007ACC.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=typescript&logoColor=white)

### UI Frameworks and libraries

![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/react-%2320232a.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=%2361DAFB)
![Bootstrap](https://img.shields.io/badge/bootstrap-%238511FA.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=bootstrap&logoColor=white)
![TailwindCSS](https://img.shields.io/badge/tailwindcss-%2338B2AC.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=tailwind-css&logoColor=white)
![Hugo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Hugo-black.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=Hugo)

### Backend

![NodeJS](https://img.shields.io/badge/node.js-6DA55F?style=for-the-badge&logo=node.js&logoColor=white)
![Express.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/express.js-%23404d59.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=express&logoColor=%2361DAFB)
![Postgres](https://img.shields.io/badge/postgres-%23316192.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=postgresql&logoColor=white)
![Elasticsearch](https://img.shields.io/badge/elasticsearch-%230377CC.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=elasticsearch&logoColor=white)
![MongoDB](https://img.shields.io/badge/MongoDB-%234ea94b.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=mongodb&logoColor=white)

### Data Analysis

![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3670A0?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=ffdd54)
![NumPy](https://img.shields.io/badge/numpy-%23013243.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=numpy&logoColor=white)
![Pandas](https://img.shields.io/badge/pandas-%23150458.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=pandas&logoColor=white)
![scikit-learn](https://img.shields.io/badge/scikit--learn-%23F7931E.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=scikit-learn&logoColor=white)
![Plotly](https://img.shields.io/badge/Plotly-%233F4F75.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=plotly&logoColor=white)
![Matplotlib](https://img.shields.io/badge/Matplotlib-%23ffffff.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=Matplotlib&logoColor=black)

I don‚Äôt like to call myself an expert in any of these - I like to think of these as tools and instruments to create my art and solve problems.

Being a good software engineer requires breadth of knowledge. You can't be aware of everything, but the more things you're aware of, the better! once you know the what and why of it, the answer to how is just a few well-executed Google searches away!

### Do checkout my pinned repositories.

Some of them might interest you.

> #### May the fork be with you

### Why do I do open-source work?

Since the advent of the internet, entire world economies, livelihoods and indeed people's lives are now largely shaped and influenced by technology. Creating software engineering knowledge and open-source technology tools, and making them **accessible** to all help level the playing ground, and reduce the reliance on monopolies by large corporations. It **empowers** individuals like you and me! üí™


### Your encouragement would mean a lot!

Open-source work takes a lot of love ‚ù§Ô∏è and time ‚è≥ to create and maintain. If you like what I do, you can help me in the following ways:

* Give a ‚≠ê to my projects.
* Consider buying me a coffee by clicking the ![Github-sponsors](https://img.shields.io/badge/sponsor-30363D?style=for-the-badge&logo=GitHub-Sponsors&logoColor=#EA4AAA) button on any of my repositories.

Thank you so much! üôèüèº
