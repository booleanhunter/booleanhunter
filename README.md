# Hi there, I'm [Ashwin](https://ashwinhariharan.com) 😄 👋

## I like creating software 💻 and communicating about it ✍🏼, mostly in the form of [technology deep dives](https://ashwinhariharan.tech/blog)!

In my career, I have worked as a full stack web developer at several technology startups, published several blog posts in leading tech publications, and spent a lot of time learning. Although my background is quite technical, I have several interests outside of the computer science domain - like user experience, science and fitness.

### Why do I do open-source work?

Since the advent of the internet, entire world economies, livelihoods and indeed people's lives are now largely shaped and influenced by technology. Creating software engineering knowledge and open-source technology tools, and making them **accessible** to all help level the playing ground, and reduce the reliance on monopolies by large corporations. It **empowers** individuals like you and me! 💪


### Your encouragement would mean a lot!

Open-source work takes a lot of love ❤️ and time ⏳ to create and maintain. If you like what I do, you can help me in the following ways:

* Consider nominating me to [Github Stars](https://stars.github.com/nominate/).
* Give a ⭐ to my projects.
* Consider buying me a coffee by clicking the ![Github-sponsors](https://img.shields.io/badge/sponsor-30363D?style=for-the-badge&logo=GitHub-Sponsors&logoColor=#EA4AAA) button on any of my repositories.

Thank you so much! 🙏🏼
