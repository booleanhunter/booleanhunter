# Hi there, I'm [Ashwin](https://ashwinhariharan.com/about) 😄 👋

🎯 *Full-stack dev | Creating Code and Writing Stories | Advocating for Usability & Developer Experience*

I'm a full-stack developer building scalable web applications with a strong focus on usability and maintainability. I also love making technical jargon understandable for both technical and non-technical audiences on my [tech blog](https://booleanhunter.com/blog).

## My software engineering principles

- Programs should be written for humans to read, and not just for computers to run.
- Favor simple code that relies mostly on cross-language paradigms, as opposed to framework-specific abstractions.
- Don't just blindly assume past tool choices are sacred!
- Prefer legibility over succinctness while writing code.

## Technologies

While I'm still trying to think of a single specialization to deep-dive into, I've explored a wide range of technologies. Here are just a few I've especially enjoyed building with:

### Languages

![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/javascript-%23323330.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=%23F7DF1E)
![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/typescript-%23007ACC.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=typescript&logoColor=white)

### UI Frameworks and libraries

![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/react-%2320232a.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=%2361DAFB)
![Bootstrap](https://img.shields.io/badge/bootstrap-%238511FA.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=bootstrap&logoColor=white)
![TailwindCSS](https://img.shields.io/badge/tailwindcss-%2338B2AC.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=tailwind-css&logoColor=white)
![Hugo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Hugo-black.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=Hugo)

### Backend

![NodeJS](https://img.shields.io/badge/node.js-6DA55F?style=for-the-badge&logo=node.js&logoColor=white)
![Express.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/express.js-%23404d59.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=express&logoColor=%2361DAFB)
![Postgres](https://img.shields.io/badge/postgres-%23316192.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=postgresql&logoColor=white)
![Elasticsearch](https://img.shields.io/badge/elasticsearch-%230377CC.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=elasticsearch&logoColor=white)
![MongoDB](https://img.shields.io/badge/MongoDB-%234ea94b.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=mongodb&logoColor=white)

### Data Analysis

![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3670A0?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=ffdd54)
![NumPy](https://img.shields.io/badge/numpy-%23013243.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=numpy&logoColor=white)
![Pandas](https://img.shields.io/badge/pandas-%23150458.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=pandas&logoColor=white)
![scikit-learn](https://img.shields.io/badge/scikit--learn-%23F7931E.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=scikit-learn&logoColor=white)
![Plotly](https://img.shields.io/badge/Plotly-%233F4F75.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=plotly&logoColor=white)
![Matplotlib](https://img.shields.io/badge/Matplotlib-%23ffffff.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=Matplotlib&logoColor=black)

I don't like to call myself an expert in any of these - I like to think of these as tools and instruments to create my art and solve problems.

Being a good software engineer requires breadth of knowledge. You can't be aware of everything, but the more things you're aware of, the better! Once you know the *what* and *why* of it, the answer to *how* is just a few well-executed Google searches away!

> #### May the fork be with you

### Why do I do open-source work?

Since the advent of the internet, entire world economies, livelihoods and indeed people's lives are now largely shaped and influenced by technology. Creating software engineering knowledge and open-source technology tools, and making them **accessible** to all help level the playing ground, and reduce the reliance on monopolies by large corporations. It **empowers** individuals like you and me! 💪


### Your encouragement would mean a lot!

Open-source work takes a lot of love ❤️ and time ⏳ to create and maintain. If you like what I do, you can help me in the following ways:

* Give a ⭐ to my projects.
* Consider buying me a coffee by clicking the ![Github-sponsors](https://img.shields.io/badge/sponsor-30363D?style=for-the-badge&logo=GitHub-Sponsors&logoColor=#EA4AAA) button on any of my repositories.

Thank you so much! 🙏🏼
